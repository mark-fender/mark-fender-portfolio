      <p className='about-text mb-3'>
        I build interfaces that feel effortless to use and memorable to look at. Frontend
        development, for me, is the sweet spot where logical problem-solving meets creative
        expression â€” transforming ideas into smooth, intuitive, and visually engaging experiences. I
        focus on writing <span className='font-medium'>clean, well-structured code</span> and
        crafting designs that are both functional and delightful to interact with. I enjoy working
        with <span className='font-medium'>modern tools and frameworks</span> to deliver software
        that is robust, elegant, and built to last. Beyond writing code, I pay attention to the
        small details that make a big difference, from subtle animations to polished interaction
        flows.
      </p>

      <p className='about-text mb-3'>
        I&apos;m endlessly curious, always exploring new technologies, experimenting with UI
        animations, and refining interaction details that elevate the user experience. My goal
        isn&apos;t just to deliver features, but to craft software that people genuinely enjoy
        using.
      </p>

      <p className='about-text'>
        When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me hiking, reading, or tinkering with side
        projects&mdash;always learning, always building.
