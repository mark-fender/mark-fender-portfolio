      <p className='mb-3'>
        I graduated with a <span className='font-medium'>master&apos;s degree</span> in
        <span className='font-medium'> computer science</span> from
        <span className='font-medium'> Technical University of Ko≈°ice</span> in 2020. I embarked on
        my journey in the tech world back in 2017 as a part-time Software Engineer, diving into
        application testing and some Java coding. The transition to full-time
        <span className='font-medium'> frontend development</span> was a game changer, and I
        instantly fell in love with it. What excites me most about frontend development is the
        perfect blend of logical problem solving and unleashing creativity for stunning designs. I
        thrive on creating software that not only works seamlessly but also looks and feels
        fantastic. My go-to stack includes
        <span className='font-medium'> ReactJS, NextJS, Angular, & TypeScript</span>. Always eager
        to learn, I stay updated with the latest technologies to bring innovative solutions to the
        table.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className='italic'>When I&apos;m not coding</span>, you can find me immersed in a
        world of video games, breaking a sweat at the gym, strumming my guitar, expanding my tech
        knowledge, getting lost in books, or brewing the perfect cup of coffee. Let&apos;s connect
        and explore the endless possibilities of tech and beyond!
